#### 1. How do computers make decisions?
* Computers can’t make decisions all by themselves. Computers are good at taking in, organizing, and processing information. Programmers need to set up situations where computers can use all of that data. 
* There situations are called **conditionals** or **if-statements**. These are set up in this way: *If* (some condition is met) *then* (a result happens)
* Example: *If it is raining, then I will wear a raincoat*. Can you find which part of this example is the condition and which is the result?
